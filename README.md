# Discover Page

## What is this?

You can find more information about Discovery Pages in the Canvas Community:

"[What is a Discovery Page?](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-14067)"

## I think I get it, but do you have an example?

Here is an example of a very basic Discovery Page. In this example we are assuming that your Canvas URL is "canvas.instructure.com". So...if you want to use a copy of this page to use for your Discovery Page then you will need to change your URL at a minimum. Oh...I should also mention that the links on the page are unlikely to work, so don't click them. It is just an example.
